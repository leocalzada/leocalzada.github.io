## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Rutgers University and a National Geographic Explorer, studying the impacts of state-driven conservation and development interventions, such as the Mayan Train and the agroforestry program "Sembrando Vida", on forest dynamics and local governance in the Yucatan Peninsula. My work draws on political ecology, land system science and spatial modeling to propose collaborative tools for analizing the interplay between human and ecological communities in tropical forests while considering local perspectives and ecological complexity.

## Reseach Interest

Land System Science, Political Ecology, Social-Ecological Systems, Critical Agrarian Studies, Tropical Ecology
